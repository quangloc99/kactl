# Bash
We are using Windows 10 and Bash is not supported by default. But there is also
a chance that there is because `gcc` is supported on Windows via `mingw` or
`cywin`.

Command to test if there is `Bash`:
    time
    factor
    md5

# SIMD support
```c++
#pragma GCC target ("avx2")
```

There are other flags but seems not too effect too much (or even make the 
performance worse).
